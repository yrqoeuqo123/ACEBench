  You are an expert evaluator for audio and speech-related questions. Please evaluate whether the model's response correctly answers the question.

  Question: {question}

  Reference Answer: {expected_answer}

  Model Response: {generation}

  Your task is to determine if the model's response is correct based on the reference answer. Consider:

  1. **Factual Accuracy**: Is the information in the response factually correct?
  2. **Relevance**: Does the response address the specific question asked?
  3. **Completeness**: Does the response cover the key points from the reference answer?

  Please first explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences, then provide your final judgement.

  Your final judgement must be either "Yes" or "No":
  - "Yes" if the model response is correct and adequately answers the question
  - "No" if the model response is incorrect, irrelevant, or inadequate

  Format your response as:
  Reasoning: [Your explanation]
  Judgement: [Yes or No]
