# Nemo Skills

Nemo-Skills is a collection of pipelines to improve "skills" of large language models (LLMs). We support everything needed for LLM development, from synthetic data generation, to model training, to evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Start developing on a local workstation and move to a large-scale Slurm cluster with just a one-line change.

Here are some of the features we support:

- [Flexible LLM inference](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/pipelines/generation/):
  - Seamlessly switch between API providers, local server and large-scale slurm jobs for LLM inference.
  - Host models (on 1 or many nodes) with [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) or [Megatron](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM).
  - Scale SDG jobs from 1 GPU on a local machine all the way to tens of thousands of GPUs on a slurm cluster.
- [Model evaluation](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation):
  - Evaluate your models on many popular benchmarks.
    - [**Math (natural language**)](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/natural-math): e.g. [aime24](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/natural-math/#aime24), [aime25](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/natural-math/#aime25), [hmmt_feb25](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/natural-math/#hmmt_feb25)

    - [**Instruction following**](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/instruction-following): e.g. [ifbench](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/instruction-following/#ifbench), [ifeval](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/instruction-following/#ifeval)
    - [**Long-context**](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/long-context): e.g. [ruler](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/long-context/#ruler), [mrcr](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/long-context/#mrcr), [aalcr](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/long-context/#aalcr)
    - [**Tool-calling**](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/tool-calling): e.g. [bfcl_v3](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/tool-calling/#bfcl_v3), [acebench](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/tool-calling/#acebench)
    - [**Multilingual**](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/multilingual): e.g. [mmlu-prox](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/multilingual/#mmlu-prox), [FLORES-200](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/multilingual/#FLORES-200), [wmt24pp](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/multilingual/#wmt24pp)
    - [**Speech & Audio**](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/speech-audio): e.g. [mmau-pro](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/evaluation/speech-audio/#mmau-pro)
  - Easily parallelize each evaluation across many slurm jobs, self-host LLM judges, bring your own prompts or change benchmark configuration in any other way.
- [Model training](https://nvidia-nemo.github.io/Skills/pipelines/training): Train models using [NeMo-RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL/) or [verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl).
